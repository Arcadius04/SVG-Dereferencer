#SVG Dereferencer
SVG Dereferencer is a console terminal application. The intended purpose of this application is to dereference a folder of exported SVG assets created by JPEXS FFDEC from a SWF file. This application can combine multiple frames into one SVG file for the SVG Room Creater application.
Additionally, it can recursively check if a specific reference sprite/shape exists to avoid duplication. Previous versions of this application allowed the creation of an SVG sprite sheet but doesn't have that feature anymore but it is possible with simple modifications.
